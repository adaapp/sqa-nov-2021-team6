# IEEE Standard for Software Quality Assurance Processes

This standard is concerned with initiating, planning, controlling and executing the Software Quality Assurance processes of a software development project.

To satisfy the standard’s point 5.3.1 (**Establish the SQA processes**), we will:

- Define and establish documented SQA processes, that exist separately from the project.

- When applied to the project, they will enable the development of software which confirms to the established requirements.

- The SQA processes will define which activities to do, how to confirm they have been performed and how to measure and track their progress.

- The SQA process will be continually improved, based on objective measures and actual project results.
